Linear Regression Machine Learning on Student Grades

This project is a simple linear regression model created to predict student math grades at 2 Portuguese schools.

Dataset with 395 instances and 33 columns was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#

Python's scikit-learn library was used to perform the modelling based on 14 features of interest, including past test scores, absences, study time, romantic relationships, extra curricular activities etc.

A linear regression model was producted an R square value of 0.764.
