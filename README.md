**Linear Regression Machine Learning on Student Grades**

This project creates a simple linear regression model to predict student math grades at 2 Portuguese schools.

Dataset with 395 instances and 33 columns was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#

Python's scikit-learn library was used to perform the modelling based on 14 features of interest.

Features used include past test scores, absences, study time, romantic relationships, and extra curricular activities.

A linear regression model was producted an R square value of 0.849 and a root mean squared error of 1.8. For refernce, the student test scores range from 0 to 20.
